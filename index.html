        <p>In Super Mario Bros., you step into the shoes of Mario, the iconic plumber with a red cap and blue overalls, or his brother Luigi in the multiplayer mode. Your mission is to navigate through the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Toadstool (later known as Princess Peach) from the clutches of the evil Bowser. Along the way, you'll encounter a host of enemies, including Goombas, Koopa Troopas, and Piranha Plants, each with their own unique challenges.

        The game is divided into eight distinct worlds, each containing four levels filled with obstacles, enemies, and hidden secrets. From lush green fields to dark underground caverns and fiery castles, each level presents a new and exciting challenge. To help you on your quest, Mario can collect power-ups such as the Super Mushroom, which makes him grow larger and stronger, the Fire Flower, which allows him to throw fireballs, and the Starman, which grants temporary invincibility. Coins are scattered throughout the levels, and collecting 100 of them will earn you an extra life, crucial for overcoming the game's tougher challenges.
